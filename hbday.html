    <h2 style="color:white" id="txt">Happy birthday!!! I hope you have an extremely great day and that you receive lots of presents. To be honest, in the last few weeks, you have become a very important person to me, mostly because I never get tired of talking to you. I know I'm hyper-annoying, and I'm sorry, but you know, you are one of the few persons I know that I can talk with feeling relaxed and forgetting about bad things for a while. Well, I know you would have preferred a drawing or something better but as I am probably the worst artist in the world, this is the most original thing I thought of, so as you sure are getting bored, I just want you to know that I appreciate you a lot and I hope to see you soon in real life :D Keep going and never change how you are! Sorry if I made lots of mistakes by the way.  </h2>
